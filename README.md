# Test Taker
This automated script will click on multiple choice tests you don't want to take on zybooks.com, but it only works if you don't get accounted for each test question you don't get wrong. It'll save a ton of time to do meaningful things in life. It will iterate through each multiple choice box and click on them for each page of assignments you have to do.


# Pre-Requisites
### Chrome Web Driver
You will need to install a chrome web driver, or the browser you prefer, from
this link and it must match your chrome version. If it doesn't work, then
stack overflow is your haven. I won't listen to these types of bugs.
Here is the link for the chrome web driver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

### Python and PIP Install
This script heavily relies on Python and PIP to run on your machine, again I
won't listen to these types of bugs but here's a handy guide to install python:

Also here's a guide to install PIP on your corresponding machine:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

### Selenium
This script also heavily relies on Selenium, an automation third party library
for Python and this script cannot be possible without. Here's a guide to install
it on your machine: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html

# How To Use
Make a git clone onto your machine, or install it as a zip and place it in a respectable folder of your choice.
Run the script on a terminal, of course you need to CD into the folder first,
by entering "python zybrowser.py" without the quotation marks.
Follow the on screen commands from your terminal and if you run into bugs,
please open an "Issues" request on Github. Thank you.
